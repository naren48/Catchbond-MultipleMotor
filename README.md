#### Multiple Motor Driven Transport of Cargo : 
The code in this repository is used to perform Kinetic Monte Carlo Simulations of multiple motors that are modeled as springs with one end that performs stochastic uni-directional motion and the other attached to cargo. Thhe fortran code in this repository specifically models the cargo being constrained by a hookean spring force that increases linearly as the cargo moves away from the trap center. The dynamics is based on the stochastic load-sharing algorithm proposed in [Kunwar and Mogilner (2010)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1478-3975/7/1/016012).
